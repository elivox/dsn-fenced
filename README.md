# Configuration
There's two type of settings:
- The GM settings can only be modified by a GM user and will affect everyone in this FVTT world.
- The Player's dice settings are linked to a player in a single world and can be modified by himself. These settings won't affect other players settings.
## Appearance

- **Enable 3D dices**: Enable the 3D dice display in this browser session.
- **Dice Presets (Faces)**: Allows to select the dices faces. Default is "Standard" where every face is a text label. Some game systems can force this value for all players to display their own dices.
- **Theme**: Allows to select a color theme for your dices. Themes changes every color settings and can pack multiple colors that will be selected at random each time you roll. A theme can also include a default texture that will be displayed if you selected "None / Auto (Theme)" in the "Texture" dropdown.
- **Texture**: Allows to select a texture for the dice. Selecting "None / Auto (Theme)" will show the theme texture if there is one.
- **Material**: Allows to select a material for the dice. Selecting "Auto (Theme)" will show the theme material if there is one. Default is "plastic".
- **Font**: Allows to select a font for the dice. Selecting "Auto (Theme)" will use the theme font instead.
- **Label Color**: Allows to change the color of the dice label. 
- **Dice Color**: Allows to change the color of the dice.

- **Edge Color**: Allows to change the color of the edges of the dice.

## Preferences
![Preview](./settings-preferences.jpg?raw=true)
- **Automatically Hide**: When enabled, the dice disappear automatically after the result is displayed.
- **Millisecs Before Hiding**: time in milliseconds after which the dice disappear automatically.
- **Hide FX**: Effect used during dice hiding
- **Sound Effects**: When enabled, custom sounds with "realistic" collision effects are played when the dices roll.
- **Sound Volume**: Let you change the dice sound effect volume. This setting is applied on top of the "Interface" volume bar.
- **Table surface for sounds**: Allows to select the type of sound made by dice hitting the virtual table.
- **Auto Scale**: When enabled, auto scale the dice dimension based on the display size.
- **Manual Scale**: Allows to manually change the scale of the dice.
- **Animation Speed**: Change the speed at which the dices roll.
- **3D layer position**: Select if dice appear on top of the UI or under.
- **Throwing force**: Change the magnitude of the vector applied to roll the dice. Let you either gently roll the dice or throw them with full force like a mad man.

## Special Effects
![Preview](./settings-sfx.jpg?raw=true)
- **Show other players special effects**: When enabled, it will play the special effects from other players settings. Disable to only show your own.
- **Add**: You can add special effects. A special effect is a short animation and/or sound played when a die roll on a specified result. Ex: Rolling a native 20 on a d20.

## Performance
![Preview](./settings-performance.jpg?raw=true)
- **Shadows Quality**: Allows to select the shadows quality. Can help with performances on some PCs.
- **Advanced lighting**: When enabled, use realistic lighting (HDRI). Disable for better performances.
- **Enable 'high density' screen support**: When enabled, it will upscale the 3D view to benefit from the extra pixels. Only have an effect on HDPI screens (like Retina display, 4k, etc). High-end GPU needed.
